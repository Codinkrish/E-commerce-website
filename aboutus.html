    <h2>ABOUT OUR COMPANY</h2>
    
    <p>When red store launched in 2022, it was with the mission "to be Earth's most customer-centric company." What does this mean? It's simple. We're a company that obsesses over customers. Our actions, goals, projects, programmes and inventions begin and end with the customer at the forefront of our minds. In other words, we start with the customer and work backwards. When we hit on something that is really working for customers, we commit to it in the hope that it will turn into an even bigger success. However, it's not always as straightforward as that. Inventing is messy, and over time, it's certain that we'll fail at some big bets too.

        You'll also hear us say that at red store, it's always "Day 1." What do we mean? Our approach remains the same as it was on Amazon's very first day - to make smart, fast decisions, stay nimble, innovate and invent and focus on delighting customers.
        
        "We continue to aspire to be Earth's most customer- centric company and we recognise this to be no small or easy challenge. We know there is much we can do better and we find tremendous energy in the many challenges and opportunities that lie ahead."</p>
   <br>
   <p>From the very beginning, we worked hard to build a special company with one simple mantra: happy employees create happy customers. In fact, our mission is to make it easy for businesses to delight their employees and customers.

    We believe that you deserve to make your customers and employees happy; no matter how big or small, whether you're just starting out, or you've been in business for years. We also believe everyone deserves access to products with uncompromising craftsmanship at
    
    affordable prices. And we make this happen, every day.
    
    We deliver intuitive and modern products designed with the end-user in mind. That means they are easy to try, easy to buy, and easy to use - even without any prior training or expertise.</p>
